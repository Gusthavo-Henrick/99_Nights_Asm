# 99_Nights_Asm
It's a game inspired in 99 Nights made in roblox, so i decided to make it in version of assembly.

Convension:

    M = Message
    P = Prompt

    S = String
    I = Int
    F = Float

    name_lower = variable
    NAME_UPPER = constant

Examples:

    M_S_INIT = Constant Message of type String
        -> Hello, world!

    P_S_INIT = Constant Prompt message of type String 
        -> Enter your name:

    I_INIT = Constant Integer 
        -> 217

    F_INIT = Constant Float
        -> 3.14
